* Set up

  1. Clone this repo.
  2. Create an account for Mathpix OCR over at [[https://mathpix.com/ocr][Mathpix]].
  3. Insert your Mathpix OCR app id and key in ~auth.el.template~, and save it
     as a new ~auth.el.gpg~ file. ~math2latex~ will then load this file and your
     credentials.
  4. Load the ~math2latex.el~ file

* Usage

  1. Have the formula you want to convert ready on the screen somewhere
  2. In emacs, move the pointer to where the LaTeX formula should go
  3. M-x math2latex
  4. Draw box around the formula you want to convert
  5. LaTeX version of your formula will appear at point
